# Serial-Port-Interface
The aim of this application is to display received data from microcontroller via UART. After the start of application, You can choose the Configuration parameters like the Com Port, BandRate, Parity, StopBits and DataBits. Also the application shows the actual values of sensors like: Date, time, microcontroller's temperature and accelerometer.

## Screenshoots
